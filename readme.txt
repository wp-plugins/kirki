Tired of all the bloated options frameworks? You can use the WordPress Customizer instead, and extend it using Kirki!


== Description ==
Kirki allows developers to add advanced controls to their customizer as well as customize the way the customizer looks and feels.

You can add beautiful options to your theme\'s customizer panel and allow your users to tweak any aspect of their theme. You\'ve got 18 control types that you can use ( 9 default + 9 custom-made ), styling options for the customizer, as well as automatic calculations for your styles using the `output` argument on your controls.

Converting from the default customizer to the syntax used by Kirki will only take a few minutes and will save you a lot of time in the long run. :)

The following controls are included:

* Radio-Buttonset
* Radio-Image
* Radio
* Checkbox
* Color
* Color-Alpha
* Dropdown Pages
* Image
* Background
* Multicheck
* Select
* Slider
* Text
* Textarea
* Upload
* Switch
* Toggle
* Sortable
* Number
* Palette
* Editor (TinyMCE)
* Select2

For documentation and examples on how to use these controls, please visit the [Kirki Wiki on Github](https://github.com/aristath/kirki/wiki).


== Installation ==

**Method 1: Use as a plugin**
From your dashboard go to Plugins => Add New.
Search for "Kirki" and install it.
Once you install it, activate it.
For configuration instructions please visit the [Kirki Wiki on Github](https://github.com/aristath/kirki/wiki).

**Method 2: Embed in your theme**

== Sample Theme ==

To get an idea on how to include Kirki in your next project, a [sample theme](https://github.com/aristath/kirki/wiki/Sample-Theme-with-Kirki) has been created.
